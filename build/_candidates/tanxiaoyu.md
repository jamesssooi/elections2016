    Hello there students of Sunway University! My name is Xiao Yu and I am currently 19 years old and I am doing my diploma in business administration. Nice to meet you! 
    
    
    As you can see here I am running for the position of Student Welfare Director in Sunway University Student Council, and my biggest goal is to make sure to help the students of Sunway University to voice out their issues, ideas, and opinions towards the management through the Student Council. Though I may not have many past experiences of being a representative of the students, but I am willing to commit and learn as I am always willing to contribute and help others when they are having difficulties. Thank you for reading and have a nice day!
