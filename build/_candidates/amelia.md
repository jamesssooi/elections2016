biography: >
     I am Amelia Goh Shey Ning. Born and raised amongst a loving family of five members, I spent a great slice of my life in the lush, flourishing city of Miri in East Malaysia. 
     
     
     Although you may tower well above my height, I am a girl with big dreams and a will power more robust than steel. Organizing events, and aiding in volunteer tasks is a habit I take pride in. Uniquely, engaging in such movements reinforced my leadership qualities, and proficiency working together as a unit. Not only did it heighten my ability to juggle my studies and school related events at an equilibrium, in like manner, it boosted my ability to make fruitful decisions amidst a team of many.
     
     
     Naturally born curious, it makes me a bit of a fanatic to be adventurous with my life which includes stepping into unfamiliar, unusual and unique environments. Likewise, listening to music and getting to know intriguing people is a daily dose that I enjoy. Albeit my energetic personality, being nervous is a flaw which I combat occasionally. Frankly, there is no greater weakness which makes my legs shiver with joy than the sight of my dog, Bear.
