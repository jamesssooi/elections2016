biography: >
    My name is Seraphine Lim. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Psychology (Hons) in 
    Sunway University. I came from Georgetown, Penang and I graduated from Penang 
    Chinese Girls High School. I am running for the position of the Extra-curricular Director in the 
    Sunway University Student Council Election 2016. 
    
    
    Although I do not have a good English 
    base compared to many local people in Sunway, I am willing to learn and contribute in 
    everything I do. I love to see people smile and I hope that in my position of being the 
    Extra-curricular Director, I am able to help those who are in need and manage the problems 
    they face. I believe that students should not just bury themselves in their studies but also to 
    have fun during their university life. I want to play a role in making the students’ experience 
    in Sunway University memorable. I believe that by encouraging students to join clubs and 
    societies, it can help to make their university life filled with joy and laughter. 
    
    
    In my capacity as the Extra-curricular Director, I want to let students be more exposed to all kinds of fun 
    events and bonding activities. In the future, I want to make the clubs and societies more 
    integrated, where the students from different clubs and societies will help each other out in 
    times of difficulties. For example, helping each other to book places and giving advise to 
    management issues. The main purpose for this is to enhance the relationship between clubs 
    and societies. I am passionate and willing to contribute to my duty as an Extra-curricular D    director, because seeing students’ university life filled with happiness will be the best 
    experience I want to achieve in Sunway University.
