    Coming into a new place and meeting a lot of new friends includes introducing yourself for a couple number of times. But as George Bernard Shaw said,  “Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” So, I will be happily introducing myself to all of you so that you all could know better about me. 
    
    
    My name is Choong Xin Yi, and I came from a beautiful town and a town which is known as ‘ food heaven’, Ipoh. One thing special about me is that, my birthday falls on Valentine’s day which you can consider me as a romantic person ! I am a sociable person and I like to work in teams, because I strongly believe that ‘unity is strength.’ Besides that, whenever I face difficulties or challenges, I will try my best to address the problem and solve it. Not only that, I will also try my very best to attend to every student’s need and comments as I would like to take  full responsibility for the welfare of the students. 
    
    
    However,  I may sometimes overthink, but I will be thinking on more future possibilities and be able to cope with it more effectively. I may be a pessimist, but I will learn to see the good part in something. I may be easily influenced by people, but I will stick on my decision if I think that what I did was right. I may be easily pleased, but I am not easily satisfied ; I will continue to work hard to strike for the best. 
    
    
    As relevant as Justin Bieber’s song, part of the lyrics is: “This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel. There's one thing that I know for sure, I'll show you”. Once again, I introduce myself as Choong Xin Yi, and I will show everyone, I can do it.
