biography: >
    Here’s an account of an ordinary person, the story of a girl who grew up in a small town in Perak called Ayer Tawar, who went to state school through primary and secondary education. It tells of a person who has been your average good student all those time but graduated high school without even bothering taking the transcript. It sings the same song with thousands of others who felt that tertiary education is a world away, but are now pursuing a degree with a passion. 
    
    
    My name is Natasha Ting. In a nutshell, I grew up in Ayer Tawar, played the violin, learned to take exams, put down the violin, burned the books, travelled, prided, saddened, worked, travelled a bit more and now, I am in Sunway. This full circle is where I learned that nobody really knows what him/herself is capable of. Continual learning from different individuals is where I built on my beliefs in people empowerment. We grow up thinking that we are smart, dumb, humorous or shy but given the right spark, we can discover a different person in us. Everyone has a value, and that has to be appreciated.
    
    
    I believe in practicality and dreams. To many that is akin to a poem composed of numbers, but to me, it is life.
