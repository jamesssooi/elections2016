biography: >
    My name is Wong Jian Xiang, currently doing BSc (Hons) Accounting and Finance in Sunway University Business School, semester 3. Previously, I was an executive member in Student Council for the batch of 15/16. Through my year of service in Student Council I participated as committee in several such as Freshies’ Night, Freshies’ Trip, Photo Marathon and more. All these events had enlightened me the importance of team coordination as leader, knowing the essence of teamwork and giving clear instruction towards the members. Besides that, I joined several clubs from last year such as Peer Counselling Volunteer, Sunway Institute Social Enterprise, Toastmasters Club and Career Peer Advisor. 
    
    
    For this election, I will be running as Director of Community Service for the batch of 16/17. The reason why I pursue for this particular position is to make a change for the campus environment and raise societal awareness for the students in Sunway University. Lastly, I am open to suggestions from everyone! So, do not hesitate to approach me if you would like to voice out your ideas. Vote for me as your next community service director as unity is strength, together we can. Thank You.
