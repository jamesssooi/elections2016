biography: >
    I am an active university student that has a strong passion in doing voluntary university activities. I am definitely the person you should call if you want to explore new challenges, and this has led me to the Sunway University Student Council. Not only that, I firmly believe that university life is not all about academics and achieving good results, but also about self-development and being an impact to the people around me. Because of that, I have decided to take a leap of faith and joined the Student Council in hopes of maximizing my time here in Sunway, and it has been 3 years since I've joined the Student Council.  My desire to contribute to the university has given me the opportunity to participate in the planning of various events, both small and large-scaled. Though I have gained many fruitful experiences throughout the years, I know that I have yet to fully utilize my potential and that urges me to constantly seek for new opportunities to grow. Hence, I wish to grow myself as a person and give my best to this university by being the Treasurer of the Sunway University Student Council.
