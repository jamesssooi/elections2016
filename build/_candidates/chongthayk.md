biography: >
    My name is Chuah Chongthayk and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting & Finance. I did my A-Levels at Methodist College Kuala Lumpur for a period of 18 months. I graduated from high school at SMK Damansara Utama and have been living in the neighbourhood since then. 
    
    
    Playing football was my passion since young and I represented at school level. As a President of Yellow House, I was moulded to be a leader and learned to take responsibility.   Not to mention, I was actively involved in Scouts’ activities and it has improved my survival skills tremendously. “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things” this quote was brought to my attention as I took up the position of Production Manager in the Young Enterprise Club.  I volunteer with ministry projects involving youth groups at my church every week. 
    
    
    On a side note, I had previously worked in a small audit firm and also in a marketing research company during my semester breaks. I have also taught children basic programming and engineering techniques such as robot-building.
