biography: >
    Hi Sunwayians! My name is Chan Bowie and I am from Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. I enjoy playing games, swimming and singing. If you are close to me, you will know that I am quite a humorous person but when it comes to work, I will turn into serious mode. I came to Sunway University in 2014 under Sunway Special Scholarship to pursue the Australian Matriculation. After passing with flying colours, I was again offered the Sunway Excellence Scholarship to pursue in BSc (Hons) of Actuarial Studies.  I am always grateful for the scholarship aids I received, therefore I have decided to give back to the school by joining Student Council last year. 
    
    
    As time goes by, I realized that I have actually gained more than what I have given out. I have learned leadership skills, communication skills and many more. Besides, I also enjoy serving student under the name of Student Council. These are the reasons why I wish to continue committing myself to Student Council by running the post of Academic Affairs Director. I am looking forward to make this university soar to its very best!
