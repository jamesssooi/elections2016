biography: >
    My name is Shireen Chin Mei Yee, from Team Ouroboros. I am currently studying Psychology in Sunway University. I am running for the position of Treasurer in the Sunway University Student Council. To many people, I may seem a little different compared to others, because I often do the things that most people would not do. 
    
    
    Other than focusing on academic, I also have a passion in music. I always choose the path that will teach me valuable lessons, that is the reason I chose to learn the guzheng. Performing in the crowd and seeing how people react to the beauty of music is what I love most. Today, I want to use the knowledge that I have acquired in the process of learning music and apply that knowledge to being the leader of a strong student board. I want to change the way people think about a university. I want to show them that university is not just a place to study and get a job, but a place for us to interact with people, a place where diversity exists.
