biography: >
    My name is Aw Wen Yong or also known as Raymond. I am currently studying Bachelor of Science (Hons) International Hospitality Management and a scholarship holder. Previously, I was studying Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) before I went to my current course. It was a hard decision to make but I decided to follow my passion. Good thing is, I like what I am doing and you will never know until you experience it or until you find your own passion. The ups and downs in life have led me to go out of my comfort zone and run as a candidate for the position of General Secretary. I wish to explore myself and see what I can do to the Sunway community in this prestigious institution.
