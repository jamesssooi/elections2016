    Determination. Curiosity. Efficiency. Creative. Leadership.
    
    
    These are the words most closely linked to who I am. In 2015, I was in the top 4% worldwide from the AUSMAT program, and was offered a full scholarship to continue my Actuarial Degree in Sunway University. I was active in the Student Mentor program in AUSMAT, giving guidance to students who require assistant. As the Vice President of Math and Science Society and having chaired in organising multiple eco-treasure hunts across three years, I developed necessary skills that allow me to work as a team as well as solve issues under time pressure. Having experience in being part of one of Malaysia’s best debating high school team (SMKDJ Debate Team), I was exposed to various controversial issues across the globe, and introduced to open-minded people who helped in shaping my character today. 
    
    
    I also have great passion for music, with 11 years of classical training and a Performance Diploma in Piano. Even after stopping classical trainings, I continue to play, write and transcribe songs in my free time.
