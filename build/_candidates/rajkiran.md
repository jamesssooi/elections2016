biography: >
    My name is Raj Kiran Kaur and I am a full-time university student in Sunway University. I am 19 years old and was born on 28th of April 1997. I graduated from SMK Kota Kemuning in 2014 and completed my foundation by December 2015. I am working to be a Software Engineer and will be graduating from Bachelors in Computer Science in December 2018. 
   
   
    Since I was a little girl, I strongly believe in standing up for what you believe in and standing out from the others. I am motivated to learn new things and venture in different areas to learn from mistakes and grow as a person. Being a woman, I want to break stereotypes that look down upon women and strive to become someone successful and independent. 
    
    
    My goals and aspirations drive me to become a better version of me and brings me forward in life. As a creative person, I have taught myself to think outside the box and challenge myself to come up with unique ideas. When I am not busy with assignments and work, I like to spend my time by reading books as it helps me keep my imagination wild and alive.
