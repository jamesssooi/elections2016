    Hello there! Felicia is my name and it was on the 23rd of February 20 years ago that I was born. I am currently enjoying my life as a first year Actuarial Studies student in Sunway University. Mathematics has been my favourite subject since I was young and being able to score well in Mathematics used to be my only goal during school time. 
    
    
    “Doing what you like and what you’re passionate about is a dream.” I am a dreamer who would like to contribute the little that I have by being the Treasurer in Sunway University Student Council for the upcoming term. During my spare time, I enjoy reading books and travelling. As I read, I picture myself as the characters in the story instead of just being a reader. One of the best parts about travelling is to be able to taste a variety of food in different places. Travelling also brings me benefits and experiences that I can never gain by having textbooks knowledge. Apart from that, I like things to be organized and well-planned beforehand. By doing so, more and better adventures can be experienced.
