biography: >
    My name is Shorolipi Emma and I am currently in my second year studying Psychology. My friends call my Lippy, which is my nickname. I enjoy participating actively in student-run events for the benefit of students, team members, friends and for external organisations (such as, charity homes/big organisations) while working with people of different authorities. I also enjoy collaborated or joined activities or events for educational and communal benefits for any participant or audience member. 
    
    
    Other than taking leadership positions in class and externally in university events, I do my best to fulfil my university experience by actively taking part in the Sunway University Choir, the Sunway Model United Nations and also the Sunway International Student Ambassadors for intercultural benefit. I take pride and utmost respect in the work and effort I put in as I am passionate about the activities I do and I am happy carry out my designated duties. My friends and those who are close to me often regard me as a hardworker, a bubbly person and someone who is open to people of all backgrounds. I enjoy meeting new people and forming good relationships with them while enjoying my university life as an enthusiastic psychologist-to-be!

manifestos:
    - title: I believe that with the combined efforts of the new student council board, we will reach out to students to take greater pride in being a Sunway University student through greater events in a small or large scale and through exciting activities. 
      content: To encourage students to join competitions, collaborate or join management and leadership enhancement events and represent themselves as proud Sunway University students/student ambassadors and to be able to make room for suggestions and student opinions that reach out to management authorities (through surveys/talks) in satisfying the many needs and wants to fulfil their university experience
    - title: I want to live in a campus where students should be made aware and are strongly encouraged to participate in the many associations and student bodies that are enthusiastic and ready to benefit students in their respective fields.
      content: As Sunway University consists of many clubs and societies, not all students know exactly what to join that may suit their abilities or serve their interests. Other than recruitment drives and promoting clubs itself, students should be encouraged to give a try for the clubs they would like to join to gage their best interest.
    - title: I believe that with great teamwork and support form students and management bodies, the Student Council is capable of creating and/or promoting more educational and hands-on events for mental, physical, social and practical development for each student.
      content: In terms of mental health, I strongly believe that a balance of work and play is essential in moulding a successful student. Efforts by students themselves such as the ‘Need for Sleep’ Project highlight the importance of mental health and learning for students. I wish to campaign for such activities that encourage healthy growth.
    - title: I believe that encouraging students to join physical activities other than constant studying is a great way to enhance learning and development. 
      content: With facilities such as our FIFA-certified field, the sports courts and the SunGym within walking distance, these outlets are ready to help students live their student life to its full potential. I believe that campaigning for a change in mental and physical understanding of students will change their perspective to become more motivated to satisfy their overall needs.
    - title: I want to live in a campus where students are not afraid to reach out to any particular student body to unleash their talent or potential as a growing individual.
      content: Further promote the positive efforts by clubs such as the SSV and PCV to build encouragement for students and know that they can work as teams and have access to voicing out their personal challenges.
    - title: I believe that fostering good and closer relationships will create a closer bridge between the university authorities and the students.
    - title: I aspire to create a university filled with students who are more high-spirited towards their investment in Sunway University.
