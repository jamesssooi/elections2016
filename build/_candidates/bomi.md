    Greetings my name is Bomi Muthe, a 2nd year Computer Science student and I will be running for this year’s Sunway University Student Council President. As a current Team Sunway soccer player we are trained to work as one team unit and self-motivated. This is the change I would like to bring to my Sunway Family.
    
    
    The pride of being a Sunway student and team spirit is lacking in many students. I believe it is through the full utilization of school facilities, events planning that I strive to bridge this gap and have every student to be involved in the Sunway day to day Life calendar.
    
    
    There is also room for further improvement in the interaction of students here at Sunway. I believe exposure opens more doors. Hence, something has to be done to get students of Sunway interacting more and getting to know one another outside their faculties. Sporting events, social media platforms are tools that will be support our interaction.
