biography: >
    My name is Kua Ching Yi and I am currently studying Bachelor of Science in Financial Analysis (Year 1). I aspire to join the Student Council because I would like to contribute my efforts to the community and society, show concern to people who are in need of help and care, and nurture my leadership and management skills along the way. 
    
    
    In the past few years, I have participated in various clubs and activities such as the Wushu club, Chinese society and was active in my school’s sport house. Joining these clubs and societies has allowed me to hone and discover a variety of life skills. Moreover, I had also played a part in conducting several co-curricular events such as my school’s Carnival, a Chinese Common Knowledge Contest for Oversea Teenagers in 2014 as well as helping out in the annual Sports Days. Unsurprisingly, every event collectively formed a platform for me to enhance my time management and organizing skills.
    
    
    During my time in college, I have joined the Sunway Foundation in Arts March intake student committee, the Sunway Business and Investment Society (SBIS) and the Young Entrepreneur Society (YES). Through these involvements, I have learnt many qualities that a leader should possess.
    
    
    Concisely, after experiencing all the failures, mistakes and hardships in the past few years, I decided to run for an election to obtain the position of Community Service Director in the Student Council in order to gain new experiences and apply all the skills and knowledge that I have learnt to contribute to the community.
