biography: >
    My name is Neetha Nair, I’m a first year student whose apart of the American Degree Transfer Program. I plan to be here up to next year’s fall after which I am hoping to leave for the United States to pursue my studies. My major is Mathematics, although still unsure about which line of field. I enjoy reading non-fiction and romance novels. As my major pretty much says it, I have an affinity for Maths. I enjoy playing the piano in my free time, so I also have a love and passion for classical and orchestral music. 
    
    
    During my high school years, I’ve participated, performed and acted in a number of school plays and concerts. I would describe myself as a very outgoing, people oriented person. I have good leadership qualities as I’ve led various types of bodies and organized events. I’m a very mature, responsible and conscientious person, the type whom you can depend on to get the job done efficiently. I’m not a perfectionist because I believe making mistakes is part of the learning curve.  Being cooperative is another one of my plus points as I’m always ready to listen and give way to other people’s opinions and voices first. 
    
    
    
    Being a part of Student Council to me is a privilege, because it’s an experience that teaches and motivates you. I feel that being given the position to be able to listen to people’s opinions or concern and do something about it is special as It gives you the chance to not only be a leader but to also have the power and influence to bring about change. One of my favourite sayings is ‘Sometimes it’s the very ones whom no one imagines of, that can do the things that no can imagine’.
