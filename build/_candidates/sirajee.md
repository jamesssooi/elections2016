    Hi Sunway University! My name is Syed Salam. Here’s a little knowledge about myself that I would like to share to all of you. I’m an International student from Bangladesh and I’m currently doing my Diploma in Business Administration. I have been staying in Malaysia for about 3 years now, and I am familiar with the culture and behaviour of the people around me. 
    
    
    I’m running for the position of Advertising and Promotion Director in the Sunway University Student Council’s election 2016. In addition, I am also a person who likes to communicate with people and make new friends, and that is also how I can understand and analyse why people behave differently. I have had many past experiences of organizing and planning events back in my country, and I really enjoy bringing people together for an event. Therefore, my aim is to make sure the students of Sunway University are aware of what is happening around the campus, and will not miss out any of the interesting events organized by Sunway University Student Council. Thank you for your time and have a nice day!
