### Campaigning Info
It's time for you to know, and be known to all students. After all, you will be representing these students for the next one year. Campaigning 
for your candidacy makes for an opportunity for you to let students know of you, your experiences, your platform, and your plans.

The campaigning period begins __3rd May to 6th May 2016__. No campaigning can be done prior to that date. Here are five (5) things you need 
to prepare for your campaign:

<div class="show-more-content">
#### 1. Your personal profile
A personal profile that consists of three (3) sections: __a 200 words biography__, __a list of your past experiences__,
and __your manifesto__ in point form.

A manifesto is basically where you outline the plans you aim to execute within your term. You must write these in point form, and you are
allowed to write a very short description of each item. For example you may write _“Increasing exposure of C&S' activities to all
students”_ and then a short description of further elaboration, or on how you plan to achieve it. However, you must vet through your
manifesto with the Election Committee first.

Your personal profile must be __submitted via email to sa.info@imail.sunway.edu.my by Friday (29th April)__.

#### 2. Your campaign poster
You will need to design your own campaign poster to be posted on the campus’ notice boards. All posters have to follow the SUSC Elections
2016 Template. That is, they must contain the SUSC Elections 2016 banner, the University's Coat of Arms & Logo, and the Jeffrey Cheah
Foundation logo. The template files and sample of previous candidate's posters can be downloaded [here](files/SUSC_Elections2016_Poster Templates_updated 20160501.zip).

All posters need to be approved by the Election Committee. You can __send the posters for approval via email to sa.info@imail.sunway.edu.my__.
Before placing the posters up, you will also need to get your posters stamped and approved by SSD (via the Student Helper desk). They will
assist you in putting up your posters throughout campus.

#### 3. Your video introduction
You will need to film a 1 to 2 minutes video introduction of yourself. This video will be publicized and published on our social media pages and
on this website. Kindly schedule a filming session with us so that our appointed videographer can film for you.

You will have a maximum of 2 minutes to make a lasting impression. So make it count! As a guideline, you may want to describe yourself, your
role in this elections, your experiences and your plan.

#### 4. Your professional photo
You will need to get a professional photo of you taken by our appointed photographer. Kindly schedule a phototaking session with us. You will need 
to be dressed in full formal.

#### 5. C&S Networking / Sharing Session
There will be a Clubs & Societies (C&S) Networking session on __3rd May 2016 at the Student Hub at 5.30PM__. You are required and invited to introduce yourself
to the student leaders of Sunway University. A short introduction will do.

There will be a sharing and Q&A session where these student leaders will ask you questions pertaining to your role, and as well as raise their 
concerns and problems that they face. 

* __What__: C&S Networking / Sharing Session
* __When__: 4th May 2016, 5.30PM - 7.30PM
* __Where__: Student Hub

#### 6. General interaction with students
You will need to directly engage and interact with the students — the very people you are representing. You will also need to campaign in at least
five (5) classrooms, and you will need to inform your respective PIC (person-in-charge) beforehand.
